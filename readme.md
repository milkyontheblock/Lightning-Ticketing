# Lightning Ticketing
Back when I still had spare time to develop small side projects, I decided to build a ticketing system in Node.js Express using GitHub Copilot.
I was mindblown. It only took me a 9 hours to build this entire project using the assistance and code predictions of Copilot's AI.
I am not planning to continue with this project, so I decided to make the repository public. Maybe someone else can learn from my code base.
